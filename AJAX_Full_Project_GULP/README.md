## Installing Node.js and updating npm

### Installing Node.js
If you’re using OS X or Windows, the best way to install Node.js is to use one of the installers from the Node.js download page. If you’re using Linux, you can use the installer, or you can check NodeSource’s binary distributions to see whether or not there’s a more recent version that works with your system.

```
$ node -v
```
The version should be higher than v0.10.32.

### Updating npm
Node comes with npm installed so you should have a version of npm. However, npm gets updated more frequently than Node does, so you’ll want to make sure it’s the latest version.

```
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```
```
$ npm -v
```
The version should be higher than 2.1.8.
